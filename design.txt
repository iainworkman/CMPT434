1. General Approach

The general approach taken was to forgo the management of transmission of data
between nodes through threads and TCP connections, instead simply iterating
through the nodes within the application itself to see if transmissions could
take place. This decision was made owing to time constraints and from the fact
that this decision had no impact on the simulation results. It was considered
that the learning experience of working with the dtn simulation would be of
greater benefit than spending the time getting TCP connections and threads set
up.

2. Functional Elements

The system was divided into the following parts:

2.1 dtn(.c/.h)
This file contains all the elements of the system related specifically to
elements of the dtn simulation (nodes, messages, grids). Contains function for
initializing the grid of dtn nodes and running the simulation.

2.2 policies(.c/.h)
The file contains all of the functions which are passed to the simulation as
function pointers in order to determine the transmission policies which the
nodes will use to tell if they should send a message to another node in range.

2.3 dtn_simulation.c
The main application for the simulation. Takes command line arguments which
determine the parameters of the simulation, runs the simulation and then
outputs the results to the screen. Can be run in verbose or non verbose modes.
