    Changes for tuxworld:
    - Doesn't accept 'localhost' properly, so have to specify 127.0.0.1 instead.
    - Has more warnings under -Wall and -pedantic, so had to remove C++ style comments and move some declarations

    Got naive adding into the server:
    - Checks the incoming command and performs said action. Because it is working off one local variable all events stored in the system end up the last one sent.
    - Still to do: - Sending responses back to the client, including success/error codes and the results of the Get commands

    client and select fixes:
    - Client networking basically works, though it is just a functional stub (connects to localhost on 30001, sends a test string then exits)
    - Bug fix to select server which wasn't properly cleaning up the socket fd once a connection was lost.
